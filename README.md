# CSharpChips
CSharpChips is a little project where we collect pieces of code that we want to share, but which do not fit naturally in any other project, yet being too small to be published as a standalone project. All code presented in the project, including tests and demos, is organised in VisualStudio projects united under one solution. However, we recommend to treat these files merely as samples of code to be copied and used in your projects, not a solid library. Whenever possible, we try to keep various concepts implemented in CSharpChips independent from one another to allow for easier integration of this code into projects.

Currently, we do not plan to release CSHarpChips in any from other then the sources, however in future we may consider making a deployable package on base of CSharpChips code. And, as always, any contribution is welcome :)
