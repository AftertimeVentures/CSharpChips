# CSharpChips
CSharpChips is a little project where we collect pieces of code that we want to share, but which do not fit naturally in any other project, yet being too small to be published as a standalone project. All code presented in the project, including tests and demos, is organised in VisualStudio projects united under one solution. However, we suggest to see these files merely as samples of code, not a solid library to include in your projects. Whenever possible, we try to keep the abstractions defined in CSharpChips independent from one another. Currently, we do not plan to release CSHarpChips in any from other then the sources, however in future we may consider making a deployable package on base of CSharpChips code.
